EXiLE
=============
EXiLE (**E**asy **Xi**b **L**ocalization **E**ntity) is meant to be an easy way to localize iOS projects that use XIBs without having to deal with duplicating the XIBs for each localization.

Documentation is forth coming, as this is a work in progress.  Check the demo app to see how it's used (note the AppDelegate setting the block and the view controller's view did load).
